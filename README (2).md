# 💰 Financial Goal Prediction Using Behavioral and Investment Signals

**Can your financial behavior predict your success? This project builds a model to find out.**

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a full machine learning pipeline that predicts an individual’s likelihood of attaining their financial goals (`GOAL_scaled`). We bridge classical financial data with behavioral economics, aiming to improve predictive insights in personal finance using demographic, behavioral, and investment indicators.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Model the relationship between **behavioral traits**, **investment habits**, and **demographics** in predicting financial outcomes.
- Test whether behavioral indicators (like risk tolerance and planning behavior) significantly explain financial goal achievement.
- Evaluate model transparency, fairness, and deployment feasibility.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Traditional financial models rarely account for **human behavior**. This project explores the integration of:
- **Behavioral signals** (e.g., `RA_total`, `PBC_total`, `BI_total`)
- **Financial habits** (e.g., `CASH`, `EQUITY`, `INSURANCE`)
- **Demographic profiles** (e.g., `AGE`, `EDUCATION`, `OCCUPATION`)

to uncover **behavior-driven prediction pipelines** that could inform future financial advisory platforms, credit scoring models, or fintech apps.

## 📈 Modeling Strategy

### 💡 Phase 1: Regression (current)

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error
```
Trained on `GOAL_scaled` as a continuous target. Early results suggest moderate predictive strength.

### 🧪 Phase 2: Classification (recommended)
Convert `GOAL_scaled` into binary or categorical buckets:
- **Binary**: Above or below population mean
- **Tertiles**: Low / Medium / High financial attainment

This increases interpretability for business decisions and public-facing tools.

## 🧰 ML Pipeline Summary

```python
# Load and split
df = pd.read_csv("CODED_DATA_cleaned_transformed.csv")
X = df.drop(columns=["GOAL_scaled"])
y = df["GOAL_scaled"]

# Train
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
print("R²:", r2_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test)))
```

> 📎 Next Steps:
> - Evaluate baseline models (e.g., Dummy Regressor)
> - Use SHAP for feature attribution
> - Track experiments via MLflow or Weights & Biases

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric       | Status      | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| R² Score     | ✔️ Reported | Needs baseline for context |
| RMSE         | ✔️ Reported | Add MAE + visualization |
| Feature Importances | ❌ Missing | Required for trust and deployment |
| Bias Testing | ❌ Missing | Consider subgroup fairness |

---

## 🧠 Explainability & Fairness

| Tool  | Use Case              | Status |
|-------|------------------------|--------|
| SHAP  | Global & local explanations | 🔄 Planned |
| LIME  | Local interpretability       | 🔄 Planned |
| Bias Audit | Gender, age fairness check | 🔄 Needed |

> ⚠️ Risk: Models trained on demographic behavior data may reflect or amplify societal biases unless audited properly.

## 🧭 Ethical Checklist

| Concern                         | Covered? | Comment |
|----------------------------------|----------|---------|
| Anonymized data                  | ✅       | No direct identifiers present |
| Informed consent                 | ❓       | Unclear from metadata |
| Bias and fairness mitigation     | ❌       | Needs implementation |
| Explainability for end-users    | 🔄       | SHAP planned |
| Misuse prevention disclaimer     | ❌       | Should be added before deployment |

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

1. 🔧 Add classification pipeline for clearer output
2. 🔍 Introduce SHAP & fairness dashboard
3. 🚀 Deploy model using Streamlit + API
4. 🧾 Publish model card with ethical analysis
5. 🧪 Compare RandomForest vs XGBoost vs Lasso
